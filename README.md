```
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURING THE PROJECT

### Adding Database Connection Values to .env

```
POSTGRESQL_PORT=5432
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
NODE_ENV=dev
```

### Installing Node.js Packages

```
POSTGRESQL_PORT=5432
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
NODE_ENV=test
```

Execute the command:

```
npm run test
```
